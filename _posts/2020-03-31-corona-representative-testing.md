*The Corona-pandemic has caught many countries off-guard. With very limited data available, administrations have to make impactful decisions under massive pressure and weighing public health against economic needs and freedom rights. To do the “right thing” while being faced with an unprecedented challenge is a monumental task for any political leadership.*

*To aid the efforts, this article proposes the introduction of Representative Sampling, a well-established method for statistical data collection and analysis. Since test capacities have been scaled up to 100,000 or more tests per week in some countries, Representative Sampling Studies could substantially improve our understanding of the pandemic. More accurate data would allow for focused counter-measures and policies, eventually removing the need for country-wide restrictions choking businesses and personal freedom rights while still improving the health situation.*

While the Corona-Virus is still spreading exponentially in many regions of the world, it becomes more and more apparent that current collection methods of infection numbers, deaths and recoveries are inadequate. Infection rates outnumber test capacities by factors estimated to be anything between 2 to 100. Consequently, available data sources are incomplete and vary massively from country to country, making comparisons not only pointless but in some cases outright dangerous.

More uncertainty is added by the fact that incubation time (average 5 days), testing time (including logistics up to 3 days) and reporting delays (up to 2 days) do not actually allow to pinpoint the time of a recorded infection accurately. Instead an unspecific data-point in the past is recorded with a time-variance of 5 to 10 days for each case. This equals trying to draw a graph with a shotgun from 10 meters away.

According to Virologists, this problem will not go away since it will be virtually impossible to provide enough test kits to test the entire population of a country.

### Representative Sampling

The obvious solution to this problem is a well-known and proven statistical method, Representative Sampling. With very limited test capacities at the beginning of the pandemic and no preparation time, conducting a study with 5,000–10,000 participants was not an option a few weeks ago. This has changed in some countries as laboratories have been working 24/7 to increase availability of test-kits. They will not be sufficient to allow testing of every citizen but there should be enough to test a reasonable sample while continuing testing the sick. The benefit of much more accurate data should still outweigh the loss of test capacity.

Implementing this method, epidemiologists should be able to identify a representative group based on relevant features (age, gender, medical conditions, geographical distribution etc.). Tests could be conducted weekly, allowing for more accurate time-lines and understanding the progression of the pandemic.

The size of the test group could be scaled from a few hundred in the beginning to a few thousand, when the test group is ready and tests are available. The results should allow for much more accurate metrics such as infection rates, lethality rates and other. Projections of this data points on the whole population would remove most of the previously mentioned uncertainties.

For future pandemics, a permanent test group could be established on-call, which would allow scientists to react much faster to new threats and would provide more flexibility and much improved reaction times.

Once a more accurate data basis is established with Representative Sampling, focus from the still relevant baseline metrics (cases, deaths, recoveries) could be shifted to the amount of available and operational Intensive Care Units (ICU).

Availability of IC-Units at any time is determined by the amount of patients requiring intensive care and/or respiration units subtracted from available units. As long as this number is greater than zero, the health care system should be able to cope with the pandemic.

To make this a function of time allowing predictions of the pandemic’s progression appropriate prediction models (e.g. [SEIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SEIR_model)) could be applied and [supplemented with timing information to model healthcare burdens.](http://gabgoh.github.io/COVID/index.html)

The models are already established and mathematically sound. With representative sampling, the challenge to determine accurate numbers should be eliminated and we could produce reliable availability projections.

This ongoing pandemic has already had extreme consequences for the global population. Now that many countries have reacted to the threat and implemented initial counter-measures, it is important to reassess our options and find the best possible solutions and intelligent answers to the most pressing questions. Evidence and intelligent deliberation should guide our next steps, not fear and desperation.
