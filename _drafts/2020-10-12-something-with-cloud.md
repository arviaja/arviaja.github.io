Yes, Gartner has probably released its 537th survey/study/prophecy that in the cloud lies the future. And so it is that pretty much every single request I got in recent years was to help moving IT-infrastructure to the cloud.

The most challenging requests are however the ones where the CEO/CTO/CIO have the feeling they should do it (move stuff to the cloud, that is) but they actually don't know what, why and how.

And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. There is a lot of peer pressure and hype created around the topic which makes decision makers feel uneasy about it. Expectations are high and investors and share-holders want something done. Even if you don't have a vision (yet) what to do with the cloud, you need to take action.
